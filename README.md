# backend-with-django
I downloaded a template from "https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page249/yamifood" and tried to implement the server-side with Django.
packages you need to install are:
- py -m pip install django
- py -m pip install pillow
- py -m pip install ckeditor

open terminal and write these commands in terminal:
$ cd restaurant
$ python3 manage.py runserver
