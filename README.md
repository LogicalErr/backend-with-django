# backend-with-django
I downloaded a template from "https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page249/yamifood" and tried to implement the server-side with Django.
packages you need to install are:
- py -m pip install django
- py -m pip install pillow
- py -m pip install ckeditor
to run the server, first open a terminal, then cd to file location, write "cd resturant", then write "py manage.py runserver".
it's a basic project and also it isn't done yet, there a lot more to do.
